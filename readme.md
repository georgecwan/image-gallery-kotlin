Class structure for the MVC classes were taken from the "Extended MVC with JavaFX" project in the cs349-sample-code
repository.

The minimize, maximize, and restore buttons work as expected on my mac, but I am not sure if they will work on Windows
machines since those buttons have different behaviours on Windows.

Images used in this project (on the toolbar buttons) were sourced from [icons8](https://icons8.com/).
